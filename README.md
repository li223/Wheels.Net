# Wheels.Net
MoreThanSmartWheels API Wrapper

## Why?
Because I'm mental, that's why.

## Er? Law Suit?
This is probably a suit waiting to happen but whatever, should obfuscate your apis more.

## Note
I don't take responsiblity for any fallout with using this wrapper. I don't handle tokens properly in this, once the default one expires you need to relogin but I'll do this properly at some point.
